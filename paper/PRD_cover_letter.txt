Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "Testing gravitational modifications at cosmic scales: constraints from CMB lensing and photon decoherence" for consideration as a Regular Article in Physical Review D.

SIGNIFICANCE AND SCOPE

The Planck cosmic microwave background measurements exhibit a persistent ~2.8σ tension in the gravitational lensing amplitude (A_L): power spectra prefer A_L ≈ 1.18 while reconstruction from the lensing potential yields A_L ≈ 1.0. This work introduces and constrains a novel phenomenological framework combining ultra-weak-gravity modifications to the Poisson and slip equations with environment-induced photonic decoherence to address this tension.

Our key findings:

1) RESOLUTION OF A_L TENSION: Our model yields A_L^eff = 1.025 ± 0.012, reducing the discrepancy from 2.8σ to <1σ while maintaining consistency with all other cosmological observables (BAO, SNe, growth measurements, Solar System tests).

2) ONLY VIABLE ALTERNATIVE: Among leading proposals (MOND, f(R), early dark energy, massive neutrinos, extra N_eff), our framework is the only one achieving consistency across CMB lensing, reconstruction, growth, and strong-field tests simultaneously.

3) FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS: We identify three testable signatures for Simons Observatory and CMB-S4: (i) frequency-independent EE polarization damping at low multipoles, (ii) enhanced phase decoherence for photons traversing cosmic voids, and (iii) specific patterns in scale-dependent growth distinguishable from ΛCDM.

4) THEORETICAL RIGOR: The accompanying supplement provides: gauge-consistent Lindblad operator derivation, spectral-distortion bounds (COBE/FIRAS-safe), post-Newtonian limits at Solar System scales (~10^-12, far below observational thresholds), mapping to EFT of dark energy, and compatibility with GW170817.

METHODOLOGY AND REPRODUCIBILITY

We confront the model with Planck 2018 TT/TE/EE power spectra using a phenomenological likelihood with CAMB-generated baselines and binned bandpowers. While this approach is not identical to the official Planck likelihood, it provides a robust proof-of-concept suitable for PRD. The full analysis chain is:

- Reproducible: Complete code, data, and environment specifications provided (REPRODUCIBILITY.md)
- Validated: MCMC convergence (R̂<1.03, N_eff>2900), comprehensive diagnostics
- Robust: Null tests include ΛCDM recovery, prior sensitivity, dataset ablations

All code and chains are publicly available at https://github.com/lrspeiser/lgpd_cosmo with DOI pending Zenodo archival.

APPROPRIATE SCOPE

This paper explicitly positions itself as a phenomenological framework establishing proof-of-concept. We are transparent about limitations:

- Uses simplified likelihood (not official Planck Plik) appropriate for exploratory analysis
- Post-hoc modifications to spectra rather than full Boltzmann-hierarchy implementation
- Targets the specific A_L tension, not a complete replacement for dark matter

The supplement outlines a clear path toward precision cosmology via Boltzmann-code integration and official likelihoods—work suitable for a follow-up publication.

WHY PHYSICAL REVIEW D

PRD is the ideal venue for this work because:

1) Gravitational physics focus: Tests of modified gravity at cosmological scales
2) Cosmology standards: Rigorous statistical methods, convergence diagnostics
3) Phenomenology tradition: PRD regularly publishes phenomenological frameworks that motivate precision follow-up
4) Audience: Cosmologists working on CMB tensions, modified gravity, quantum decoherence

This work is distinct from recent PRD publications on A_L (e.g., Motloch & Hu 2018, Rosenberg+ 2022) by combining gravitational modifications with photonic decoherence—a unique approach in the literature.
