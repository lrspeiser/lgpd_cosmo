\begin{abstract}
The Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization power spectra exhibit an apparent gravitational lensing amplitude ($A_L$) approximately $2.8\sigma$ higher than the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, while direct lensing reconstruction from the trispectrum yields $A_L\simeq 1$. 
We introduce and constrain a phenomenological framework combining two ultra-weak-gravity modifications: 
(i) scale- and redshift-dependent responses in the Poisson and slip equations, $\mu(k,z)$ and $\Sigma(k,z)$, which modulate structure growth and the Weyl potential at scales $k\lesssim 0.1\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and redshifts $z\lesssim 2$, and 
(ii) a low-gravity photonic decoherence (LGPD) mechanism, modeled via a Lindblad master equation, that introduces a small frequency-independent damping of CMB anisotropies in regions of ultra-weak gravitational acceleration while preserving the blackbody spectrum to within COBE-FIRAS limits.
By construction, both modifications vanish in strong-field regimes (Solar System, compact objects), respecting existing tests of General Relativity.

Confronting this model with Planck 2018 TT/TE/EE power spectra using a phenomenological likelihood, we obtain 
$\mu_0 = 0.041^{+0.180}_{-0.228}$, 
$\Sigma_0 = 0.025^{+0.037}_{-0.035}$, and 
$\xi_{\rm damp} = 0.0038^{+0.0035}_{-0.0026}$ (68\% credible intervals), 
all consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM limit but allowing a mild $\Sigma_0>0$ tail.
The effective lensing amplitude from lensed spectra is $A_L^{\rm eff} = 1.025^{+0.013}_{-0.012}$, reducing the Planck tension from $2.8\sigma$ to $<1\sigma$ while remaining consistent with large-scale structure growth measurements.
Model comparison yields $\Delta\chi^2\approx -7.7$ and marginal statistical preference ($\Delta{\rm AIC}\approx -5.4$) over $\Lambda$CDM.
Critically, we find no conflict with constraints from baryon acoustic oscillations, supernovae, redshift-space distortions, Solar System tests, or spectral-distortion limits.

This work establishes a phenomenological proof-of-concept that ultra-weak-gravity modifications combined with environment-induced photon decoherence can reconcile the CMB lensing amplitude anomaly without degrading concordance elsewhere.
We outline a path toward a microphysically complete theory via explicit Boltzmann-hierarchy modifications and Lindblad-operator derivations, and we identify falsifiable signatures---frequency-independent polarization damping at low multipoles and excess phase decoherence for photons traversing cosmic voids---testable with upcoming surveys (Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid).
The framework presented here is \emph{not} a full replacement for dark matter; rather, it targets the specific $A_L$ anomaly within a broader landscape of cosmological tensions, and serves as a controlled testbed for exploring gravitational and quantum-optical effects in the ultra-weak regime.
