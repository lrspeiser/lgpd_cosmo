\subsection{CMB constraints}
We present posteriors for $(\mu_0,\Sigma_0,\xi_{\rm damp})$ from TT+TE+EE, and consistency with lensing $A_L$.

\subsection{Joint constraints}
With BAO+SNe+growth, we show that background distances remain consistent while growth/lensing mildly prefer (or disfavor) nonzero $\mu,\Sigma$.

\subsection{Derived parameters}
We report $A_L$ and growth index $\gamma$ in the presence of $\mu,\Sigma$.
