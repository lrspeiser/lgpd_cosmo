\subsection{CMB}
We use Planck 2018 TT/TE/EE bandpowers with covariances and, where indicated, the lensing reconstruction likelihood.

\subsection{BAO, SNe, Growth}
We include BAO distance measurements, SNe distance moduli, and $f\sigma_8$ growth data with their published covariances. 

\subsection{Spectral distortions}
We enforce $|\mu| \lesssim 9\times 10^{-5}$ and $|y|\lesssim 1.5\times 10^{-5}$ via a prior from a simple distortion calculator.
