\subsection{LGPD}
We posit a Lindblad evolution for the photon density matrix with a low-gravity-triggered rate $\Gamma(a)$ driving the specific intensity $I_\nu$ toward a blackbody $B_\nu(T_{\rm LGPD})$. 
A small emissive/absorptive component ensures $\mu$-type distortions vanish, consistent with FIRAS/Planck.

\subsection{Linear response: $\mu(k,z), \Sigma(k,z)$}
Metric perturbations obey a modified Poisson equation with $1+\mu(k,z)$ and gravitational slip parameterized by $\Sigma(k,z)$, recovering GR as $\mu,\Sigma\to 0$ in strong fields. 
We adopt smooth transitions in $k$ and $z$ for both functions.
