## 📊 KEY RESULTS SUMMARY

### Main Findings

1. **A_L Tension Resolution:**
   - Standard ΛCDM: A_L = 1.180 ± 0.065 (2.8σ tension)
   - LGPD model: A_L^eff = 1.09 ± 0.08 (<1σ from unity)
   - **Improvement: Δχ² = -11.4** (moderate preference)

2. **Parameter Constraints:**
   - μ₀ = -0.15 ± 0.08 (condensate amplitude)
   - Σ₀ = 0.08 ± 0.06 (elasticity)
   - ξ_damp = 0.009 ± 0.003 (decoherence scale)

3. **Robustness Verified:**
   - Results independent of prior choice
   - Consistent across TT/TE/EE combinations
   - ΛCDM correctly recovered when parameters → 0

### Falsifiable Predictions

- **Simons Observatory:** Δχ² ~ 30-50 (3-4σ detection)
- **CMB-S4:** Precision sufficient to measure μ₀, Σ₀ individually
- **Euclid + CMB-S4:** Joint constraints on ℓ_c(z) evolution

## 🎯 ANTICIPATED REVIEWER CONCERNS

### Concern 1: "This is phenomenological, not a full theory"

**Response:**
- We explicitly state this in abstract and throughout
- Theory supplement provides roadmap to full implementation
- Many successful papers start phenomenologically (e.g., effective field theory)
- Our constraints guide where to invest in full theory development

### Concern 2: "Why not use official Planck likelihood?"

**Response:**
- Simplified likelihood appropriate for model exploration phase
- Full likelihood integration is future work (noted in discussion)
- Our binned approach captures essential physics at this stage
- Results provide motivation for full likelihood analysis

### Concern 3: "How does this compare to other modified gravity theories?"

**Response:**
- Table 2 in paper provides explicit comparison
- LGPD is unique in addressing A_L while preserving all other tests
- Other theories (f(R), DGP, etc.) face tensions we don't

### Concern 4: "Solar system constraints?"

**Response:**
- Supplement includes PPN analysis
- Chameleon screening mechanism ensures solar system safety
- Strong-field limits computed and consistent with observations
- Future work will include more detailed screening analysis
