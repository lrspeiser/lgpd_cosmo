# PRD SUBMISSION STATUS

Date: October 6, 2025  
Status: In progress ‚Äî Phenomenological pipeline; not yet ready for PRD submission

---

Summary
- The codebase and pipeline are in good shape and reproducible. We have a working phenom analysis with quick fits and initial model comparison. However, several critical items remain before a credible PRD submission.
- This document has been updated to reflect current reality. Prior claims of ‚ÄúREADY FOR SUBMISSION‚Äù, A_L resolution, and full robustness should be treated as placeholders and are superseded by the checklist below.

---

Current results (quick, non-PLC; for orientation only)
- Multiprobe phenom fit (Planck binned TT/TE/EE + BOSS DR12 DV/rs + Pantheon SNe + growth):
  - Constant Œº model: AIC ‚âà 29829.30, BIC ‚âà 29840.47
  - Two-bin Œº(z) model (z_split=0.5): AIC ‚âà 29820.68, BIC ‚âà 29835.58
  - ŒîAIC ‚âà -8.62, ŒîBIC ‚âà -4.89 favor binned model in the quick pipeline
- Redshift trend diagnostics (preliminary):
  - SNe: mild negative residual trend vs z (significant with large N) ‚Äî interpretation deferred until PLC and calibrated BAO are in place.
  - BAO, Growth: only 3 points (BOSS DR12) ‚Äî insufficient for trend inference.

Caveats
- Not using official Planck PLC likelihood yet (TT/TE/EE bandpowers and full covariance absent in current quick binned CSV path).
- BAO and growth compilations are minimal (3 points); need broader datasets and covariances for publication claims.
- Reported AIC/BIC values are from exploratory phenom fits and should not be quoted as final results.

---

Completion checklist (updated)

Core analysis
- [ ] Integrate official Planck PLC likelihood (TT/TE/EE, low-‚Ñì, lensing) via configs/planck_plc_paths.json (paths must exist on this machine)
- [ ] Ingest robust BAO compilation (‚â•10 points; BOSS DR12 + others) with covariances
- [ ] Ingest robust growth fœÉ8 compilation (‚â•15 points) with uncertainties
- [ ] Decide baseline model for paper (constant Œº0 recommended for main text; keep two-bin Œº(z) for tests/appendix)
- [ ] Run production MCMC (e.g., 64√ó2000+) and compute convergence metrics (RÃÇ, ESS, œÑ)

Robustness and validation
- [ ] ŒõCDM recovery (Œº=Œ£=Œæ=0) under PLC
- [ ] Prior sensitivity (√ó2 wider/narrower)
- [ ] Dataset ablations (TT-only, TT+TE, TT+TE+EE) under PLC
- [ ] œá¬≤ breakdown per dataset and comparison against ŒõCDM
- [ ] Optional: nested sampling for evidence (Bayes factor)

Figures/tables (regenerate after production runs)
- [ ] Power spectra with residuals (TT/TE/EE) under best-fit
- [ ] Posterior corner plots (chosen model)
- [ ] AIC/BIC (and optionally evidence) comparison table (constant vs binned)
- [ ] Robustness summary table with PLC-backed results

Documentation and claims
- [ ] Replace all placeholder claims about A_L, ‚ÄúREADY FOR SUBMISSION‚Äù, and full robustness with PLC-backed, dataset-complete results
- [ ] Add a clear ‚ÄúKnown limitations‚Äù section (phenomenological assumptions, background consistency, etc.)
- [ ] Update README_DATA.md with BAO/growth compilation provenance and formats

---

Next actions (immediate)
- Provide valid paths in configs/planck_plc_paths.json and ensure planck_env.sh is sourced.
- Run: python scripts/run_planck_plc_fit.py --quick --mu-model constant (and binned), compare AIC/BIC and Œîœá¬≤ under PLC to select the baseline model.
- Expand BAO/growth datasets (I can ingest your preferred compilations into data/).

---

Notes
- All previous sections asserting completion/readiness are intentionally removed or superseded. We will re-populate once PLC-backed production analyses are complete.

## üéØ ANTICIPATED REVIEWER CONCERNS

### Concern 1: "This is phenomenological, not a full theory"

**Response:**
- We explicitly state this in abstract and throughout
- Theory supplement provides roadmap to full implementation
- Many successful papers start phenomenologically (e.g., effective field theory)
- Our constraints guide where to invest in full theory development

### Concern 2: "Why not use official Planck likelihood?"

**Response:**
- Simplified likelihood appropriate for model exploration phase
- Full likelihood integration is future work (noted in discussion)
- Our binned approach captures essential physics at this stage
- Results provide motivation for full likelihood analysis

### Concern 3: "How does this compare to other modified gravity theories?"

**Response:**
- Table 2 in paper provides explicit comparison
- LGPD is unique in addressing A_L while preserving all other tests
- Other theories (f(R), DGP, etc.) face tensions we don't
