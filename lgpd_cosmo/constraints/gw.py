# Gravitational-wave Propagation Constraints

Purpose
- Provide a place to compute constraints from GW propagation (speed, friction/damping α_M, GW luminosity distance) once a mapping from LGPD parameters is established.

Status
- Requires mapping from (μ, Σ, ξ_damp, etc.) or EFT α_M/α_B/α_T to the GW sector.
- GW170817 requires c_T = c at low redshift; models must satisfy this.
- Standard siren H0/GW luminosity distance tests can be integrated later.
