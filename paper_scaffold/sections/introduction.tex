\paragraph{Motivation.} GR passes strong-field tests, yet low-acceleration regimes on galactic/cluster scales show anomalies typically attributed to dark matter and dark energy. We explore an alternative in which spacetime ``unravels'' in low gravity, altering photon coherence (LGPD) and linear gravitational response ($\mu,\Sigma$), while maintaining GR in strong fields.
