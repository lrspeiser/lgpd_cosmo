\subsection{Baseline and modifications}
We generate baseline $C_\ell$ with CAMB/CLASS and apply modifications using $\mu(k,z)$ and $\Sigma(k,z)$ within the Boltzmann hierarchy (preferred), or via a calibrated phenomenological modulator (used as a cross-check).

\subsection{Sampling}
We sample $(\mu_0,\Sigma_0,\xi_{\rm damp},\ldots)$ with wide priors using ensemble MCMC and monitor convergence via split-$\hat R$, autocorrelation times, and ESS.

\subsection{Model comparison}
We report $\Delta\chi^2$ vs.\ $\Lambda$CDM and information criteria (AIC/BIC) for nested models.
